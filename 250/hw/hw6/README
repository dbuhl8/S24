Hello Uli, 

Here is a breakdown of my hw4 submission. each subdirectory will contain a Makefile, so all you will have to do is type "make" and the fortran file will be compiled with mpif90. Then to run the executable, either submit a slurm job with whatever slurm script is placed within that directory. 

For example: inside the "hello" directory simply, 
-> $ make
-> $ sbatch hello.slurm

This will submit a slurm job according to the details in the slurm script. If you have any questions about the Slurm scripts or Makefile please let me know. 

Let me know if anything goes wrong or if something seems confusing. Thank you!
