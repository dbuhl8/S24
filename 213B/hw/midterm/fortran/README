Hi Luan,

Some notes about my submission for HW2. So I did this assignment with part of it in Fortran and part of it in Matlab. 

In order to produce most of the plots for hw2, please see the abs_stab_test.m matlab file. Running this will produce 4 absolute stability plots. 

For the AB3 trajectory plots please 'make' in this directory. It will compile, execute, and run a fortran driver and then make three plots with gnuplot with the trajectories for the three different dt's used. 

The main reason I used two different languages, is because most of the assignment isn't about the numerical methods, but more about analyzing the numerical methods. So I only did code for the numerical method problem (performing AB3) in fortran. Let me know if it is too comfusing or if you need help running the code!

Thank you!
